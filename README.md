NOTE FROM ELSHNKHLL:

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning after following all instructions to the letter it didn't work on my MAC.
After pressing [Start] button üéß symbol apeeared on TV but no sound came of my speakers.
In order to make it work, i was forced to run FFPLAY on separate terminal manually, 
in a folder with the file roku.sdp containing following text.
